Basic Scalatra setup based on https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra-sbt-prototype

General idea is to compare speed of Scalatra + Scalate. Please let me know if I've set anything up stupidly.

Also testing:
* Spring MVC: https://github.com/thesmith/testspringmvc
* Bowler: https://github.com/thesmith/testbowler

Supprisingly, this performs worst out of the group, so I'd really like to know why!
